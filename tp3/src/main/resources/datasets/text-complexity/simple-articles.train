COLORADO SPRINGS — A gun battle erupted inside a Planned Parenthood center here on Friday when a man armed with an assault-style rifle opened fire and began shooting at officers as they rushed to the scene. The authorities reported that three people were killed, a police officer and two civilians, and nine were wounded before the suspect finally surrendered more than five hours after the first shots were fired.

A police official in Colorado Springs identified the man in custody as Robert Lewis Dear.

The police did not describe the motives of the 57-year-old gunman. For hours on Friday, officers traded gunfire with him inside the clinic before they were able to shout to the man and persuade him to give up, according to Lt. Catherine Buckley, a police spokeswoman.

“The perpetrator is in custody,” Mayor John Suthers said at an evening news conference. “There is a huge crime scene that has to be processed,” he said, “and we have to determine how many victims there are.”
The shooting came at a time when Planned Parenthood has been criticized because of surreptitious videos made by anti-abortion groups of officials discussing using fetal organs for research. It transformed a shopping area near the clinic into chaos as snow fell and gunshots rang through the parking lot. Black-clad tactical officers stood guard with guns in hand, ambulances lined up and dozens of shoppers and employees were ordered to stay away from windows and lock their businesses’ doors.

The encounter could be heard in transfixing detail on the police scanner, with the authorities describing how they had driven a BearCat armored vehicle into the Planned Parenthood building, smashing through two sets of doors into the lobby and rescuing some of those inside.

“We’re exchanging gunfire,” one officer said on the radio. “We are trying to keep him pinned down.”

“Put gunfire through the walls,” came a reply. “Whatever, we got to stop this guy.”

The standoff, which began shortly after 11:30 a.m., was terrifying for the family members of those inside, such as Joan Motolinia, who said his sister called him from the center as the shots began.

“As soon as I heard the shots, she hung up on me,” he said. “And I didn’t want to call her back and risk her life.”

The officer killed in the shooting was identified late Friday as Garrett Swasey, 44, a six-year member of the University of Colorado campus police force here. He was among scores of law-enforcement officers, medics and firefighters from the Colorado Springs Police Department, the university police, the El Paso County sheriff’s office, the F.B.I. and other agencies who raced to the scene.	
Despite being at a heightened state of alert, F.B.I. officials in Washington appeared caught off guard in the hours after the shooting and said that they knew little about what occurred.

At a news conference at Penrose Hospital in Colorado Springs, Fire Chief Christopher Riley said he had met with four officers wounded in the shooting and said they were all doing well, conscious and talking, “but obviously injured and shaken.” The conditions of others wounded were not immediately known, and some confusion remained hours after the shooting. One woman who had been inside the clinic said she was still trying to find her boyfriend, who had been with her.

The local authorities were visibly shaken as they stood in the snowy dark to announce that the suspect had been taken into custody and that the siege was over. Much remained unknown, including how many people had been inside the clinic and how the gunfire had erupted. Cathy Alderman, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said the group believed all of its staff members were safe, but was still working to confirm the status of its patients.

Officials from both law enforcement and Planned Parenthood said they did not know whether the group’s Colorado Springs center had been specifically targeted. But the attack carried echoes of other violent assaults on abortion providers, and it prompted the police in New York City to deploy units to Planned Parenthood clinics in the city.

In a statement, Vicki Cowart, president of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said the group had strong safety measures and worked closely with local law enforcement.

“We don’t yet know the full circumstances and motives behind this criminal action, and we don’t yet know if Planned Parenthood was in fact the target of this attack,” she said. “We share the concerns of many Americans that extremists are creating a poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism in this country. We will never back away from providing care in a safe, supportive environment that millions of people rely on and trust.”

Since abortion became legal nationally, with the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade in 1973, many abortion clinics and staff members across the country have been subjected to harassment including death and bomb threats, and hundreds of acts of violence including arson, bombings and assaults and eight murders, according to figures compiled by the Naral Pro-Choice America Foundation.

Planned Parenthood’s Colorado Springs center was one of many locations around the country that became the site of large anti-abortion protests over the summer after abortion opponents released surreptitious videos of Planned Parenthood officials discussing using fetal organs for research. On Aug. 22, the day of nationwide protests to defund Planned Parenthood, more than 300 people protested outside the clinic here, according to local news reports.

Colorado Springs is an area of fast growth about 60 miles south of Denver and home to an Army base and an Air Force base. Bryan Hawke, 35, a chiropractor who was holed up with six others in his one-story brick-fronted chiropractic office that is across the parking lot from Planned Parenthood, said the center is the scene of near-daily protests.

“There are protests of varying sizes outside that building probably six days a week,” he said. Sometimes the protests attract as many as 200 people, but “most days there are a dozen people there,” he added.

Mr. Hawke’s receptionist first heard gunshots Friday morning and started shouting. “I heard them yelling at me to grab the keys,” he said. He quickly
Mr. Hawke spent the morning watching SWAT team members swarm the parking lot. They were clad in black, wearing helmets and shields. They spent time pulling people from their cars — people had been stranded in their vehicles when the shooting began.

Denise Speller, a manager at a Supercuts salon near the shooting scene, said she saw police cars streaming through the small shopping center and pull up by a nearby Chase bank as gunshots echoed across the parking lot. She said she saw one officer positioned by his cruiser apparently struck by a bullet.

“We just saw him go down,” Ms. Speller said in a telephone interview. locked the door.

Security concerns at the clinic were high enough that the clinic had a “security room” with a supply of bulletproof vests, but, according to an officer on the scanner, some of the vests were still in the room, and one may have been worn by the gunman.

With people sheltering inside the clinic, restaurants and stores, the police ordered residents to stay away from Centennial Boulevard and were checking on the safety of those in the area. “We have put officers and detectives in the different businesses at this point,” Lieutenant Buckley said.

Paul Lambert, the owner of Steins and Vines, a liquor store nearby, said he and an employee were told by the police to lock the door to the shop. Earlier Friday morning, Mr. Lambert said, some of his employees heard gunshots but did not know where they were coming from.

“They had us lock the doors and stay inside where it’s safe,” Mr. Lambert said in a telephone interview.

Looking out his front door, he said he was watching the police evacuate drivers from their cars into a nearby supermarket.

The police said on Twitter that people inside a shopping center and a grocery store nearby were told to shelter in place. The police closed Centennial Boulevard in both directions.
COLORADO SPRINGS — The injured man staggered into the grocery store, his face and chest bloodied. Customers stopped and stared. “He lifted his shirt up and he had holes in his chest,” said Miranda Schilter, 17, who had been waiting for a drink at an in-store coffee shop.

Just minutes earlier, a gunman had gone to the parking lot of a Planned Parenthood center here and unleashed a barrage of bullets, turning a bustling snow-covered shopping center into a tableau of chaos and fear that lasted for more than five hours.

Ms. Schilter dived behind the coffee counter when the shooting began. A woman who identified herself as a nurse rushed to help the bloodied man who had just walked in.

As the nurse held his hand, he told people that he had been shot by a man in the parking lot between the Planned Parenthood clinic and the grocery store.

“He was just so much in shock,” said Taylor White, 23, who was in the store. “He was like, ‘Some crazy person out there is shooting people.’ ”

At Fusion Nails, in the shopping complex south of the Planned Parenthood center, Quan Hoang said he was working when he saw police cars swarming in the parking lot near a bank down the street. He stepped outside and heard three gunshots, and officers told the shop’s workers and customers to go inside, lock the doors and stay away from the windows.

About two hours after the first reports of gunshots, Mr. Hoang said three officers were still posted outside his front door, one of them brandishing a shotgun.

“It’s unreal,” Mr. Hoang said.
Investigators on Saturday were looking into Mr. Dear’s motive, and little was immediately known about him. He registered to vote in Colorado only a year ago. Before that he had drawn the attention of law enforcement officials in North Carolina and South Carolina, who accused him of minor offenses and traffic violations.

But on a snowy Friday after Thanksgiving he took control of a women’s health clinic that, like so many of its kind across the country, has become a magnet for anti-abortion protests. The protests have been fueled in recent months by the release of surreptitious videos of Planned Parenthood officials discussing using fetal organs for research.

On Saturday, President Obama again called on America to tackle gun violence. “This is not normal,” he said in a statement. “We can’t let it become normal. If we truly care about this — if we’re going to offer up our thoughts and prayers again, for God knows how many times, with a truly clean conscience — then we have to do something about the easy accessibility of weapons of war on our streets to people who have no business wielding them.”

Those who were caught near the carnage on Friday described an excruciating, hourslong wait for either the police to restore safety — or the gunman to pierce their hideouts. People inside the clinic holed up in an ultrasound room and other hideaways.

Mr. Dear stalked a man who was crawling through the parking lot, apparently trying to hide, a witness told news outlets. He was focused on the medical clinic but indiscriminate with his targets, firing his long gun into the entryway before turning around and shooting through the windshield of the witness, a man who tried to flee after dropping off friends there.

Mr. Dear stood his ground through a gun battle with the police until they eventually coaxed him into surrendering. On Saturday, he was being held without bond at the El Paso County Criminal Justice Center.

The rampage cut short a busy workday at the clinic, with 30 people signed up for appointments and many more walking in to pick up prescriptions or get health screenings.

It left the country to reckon yet again over widespread access to assault-style weapons and carried echoes of past violence at clinics that handle abortions and reproductive health, including arson, bombings, assaults and murders.

Officers struggled to get inside the clinic and make contact with the gunman, talking over the police scanner about firing through the walls in a desperate attempt to stop the bloodshed.

As the shots rang out, employees and customers at businesses around the Planned Parenthood — a bank, a beauty supply center, a nursing home — quickly locked their doors, hiding behind walls and sending frantic notes to parents, spouses and children. Most would remain there for hours, some occasionally catching glimpses of the prolonged gun battle.

William Carson, 23, of Aspen, Colo., had just gotten out of his car in the parking lot outside the grocery store, King Soopers, when he heard shots. In town for the holiday, he had run out for bandages after his mother cut her hand while making breakfast.

Mr. Carson noticed a number of police cars, but the horror registered only when he began hearing the gunfire.

"I heard six or seven shots while I was still out of the car," Mr. Carson said in a phone interview. "One second in between each shot. Fast, but not machine gun fast."

He quickly ducked into the Joint, a chiropractor’s office in the strip mall north of King Soopers. He saw a cluster of officers behind riot shields moving north with their guns drawn. Along with a receptionist and four patients, he spent most of the day following events online and trying to reassure his family.

"I was making plans in my head," he said. "And I was on the phone with my mom and my brother and making plans to escape through the back."

An official with Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains had been one of the people caught on the surreptitious videos made by abortion opponents and released this summer. The tapes captured a conversation with a medical director in Denver talking about using fetal organs for research. More than 300 people protested outside the Colorado Springs clinic on Aug. 22, a day of nationwide protests aimed at getting federal and state lawmakers to defund Planned Parenthood in the wake of the videos’ release.

Vicki Cowart, the president of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said that it appeared that the suspect "broke his way in" to the building, but that she did not know precisely how the attack had unfolded. She said that abortion opponents regularly protested on the public street outside the center, shouting at staff and patients, but that there had been no specific threats against the Colorado Springs clinic.

"We had no reason to suspect anything," she said.
Canyon Lake Ranch was once a playground for Christian day campers, and then was a corporate retreat with water-skiing, barbecues and cowboy shoot-’em-up shows. Hawks now circle above 108 sunbaked acres occupied by copperhead snakes, a few coyotes and the occasional construction truck.

Soon this ranch will be a gated subdivision of 99 mini-mansions designed for buyers from mainland China. The developer, Zhang Long, a Beijing businessman, is keeping three plots to build his own estate along the site of an old rodeo arena.

This luxury development 35 miles northwest of Dallas is the latest frontier in a global buying phenomenon as Chinese money becomes a major force in real estate around the world. The flood of money is likely to persist despite the current tumult in China. While a currency devaluation and stock market crash have crimped the country’s buying power overseas, the resulting uncertainty is making many Chinese individuals and companies eager to invest anywhere except their home country.

In London, Chinese investors are purchasing high-end apartments in wealthy neighborhoods and big skyscrapers in the financial district. In Canada, they are paying $1 million for modest Vancouver bungalows. In Australia, a Chinese sovereign wealth fund bought nine office towers, one of the biggest real estate transactions in that nation’s history.

In the United States, the home-buying spree began on the coasts, where Chinese buyers snapped up luxury condos in Manhattan and McMansions in Silicon Valley, pushing up home values in big cities. It is now spreading to the middle of the country, where prices are more modest and have room to run.

The homes here in Corinth will feature two master suites, one for the buyers, the other for aging parents. A concierge service will help new arrivals from overseas order Internet service and pay electric bills. Chauffeurs will ferry homeowners until they learn to navigate the loops and spurs of Texas freeways.

“When Chairman Zhang saw the strength of the Texan economy, he decided it was time that the Asian community should be presented an opportunity to invest in the American Dream,” marketing materials for the development read.

The great property rush is part of the tidal wave of Chinese money that is pouring into the global economy and reshaping financial markets. In residential and commercial real estate, the new flow of cash is upending the traditional dynamics of buying and selling.

This year, Chinese families represented for the first time the largest group of overseas home buyers in the United States. Big spenders on new homes are helping prop up local economies in the Midwest. But in dense areas like San Francisco and Manhattan, they are also affecting the affordability and availability of housing, as demand outpaces supply and bidding wars ensue.

While Chinese purchases make up a small sliver of overall sales in the United States, they have had a disproportionate impact on the market for more expensive properties, buying one in 14 homes sold for more than $1 million. On average, buyers from China, including the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong, pay $831,800 for a home, more than three times as much as Americans spend, according to a National Association of Realtors survey.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Carolyn Bouchard, a diabetic with a slowly healing shoulder fracture, hurried to see her doctor after Matt Bevin was elected governor here this month.

Ms. Bouchard, 60, said she was sick of politics and had not bothered voting. But she knew enough about Mr. Bevin, a conservative Republican who rails against the Affordable Care Act, to be nervous about the Medicaid coverage she gained under the law last year.

“I thought, ‘Before my insurance changes, I’d better go in,’ ” she said as she waited at Family Health Centers, a community clinic here.

    UnitedHealth Group said it was losing money on the Affordable Care Act's health exchanges.
    Instability in Marketplaces Draws Concern on Both Sides of Health LawNOV. 27, 2015

Over the last few years, Kentucky captured the nation’s attention as the only Southern state to wholly embrace the health care law, most significantly by expanding Medicaid in 2014 to cover an additional 425,000 people so far. Now, with Mr. Bevin promising to “repeal the expansion as it currently exists,” Kentucky may become a laboratory for the kind of rollback that the law’s opponents have so far only dreamed of.
Nationally, both parties saw the governor’s race as a crucial political test for the Affordable Care Act months after it survived a second major challenge before the Supreme Court.

Republicans were elated by Mr. Bevin’s sound defeat of Jack Conway, the state’s Democratic attorney general, seeing it as a blatant rejection of the health law and proof that it remains a giant liability for Democrats heading into 2016. Mr. Bevin won all but a few counties, including those with the largest percentage of residents on Medicaid.

For Democrats, Mr. Conway’s loss illustrated the challenges they may face motivating voters in next year’s presidential and congressional races, not least those the health law is helping. Low-income people, the beneficiaries of the expanded Medicaid program, are the least likely to vote, research has found. And the turnout this month in Kentucky, one of the poorest states, was particularly low: 31 percent.

The stakes for the new Medicaid beneficiaries — 10 percent of the state’s population — were on vivid display as patients churned in and out of exam rooms at Family Health Centers this month. Finus Jefferson, 56, had new coverage that allowed him to get a CT scan the previous week when he experienced shortness of breath; Candace Rivera, 20, used her insurance to have a painful growth surgically removed last spring; and Jonathan Osborne, 36, left with a referral to a spine specialist who would not have seen him had he still been uninsured.

Mr. Bevin has said all along that he would dismantle Kynect, the state’s successful insurance exchange where people shop for private coverage, and move its customers to HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange serving 38 states. But his statements about Medicaid have shifted over time. Early in his campaign, he said he would reverse the Medicaid expansion completely. More recently, including in several interviews since Election Day, he has said he would seek federal permission to tighten eligibility for the program and impose more rules and costs on the so-called expansion population.

Many patients at Family Health Centers said they had heard little about any of his health care plans. But with Mr. Bevin preparing to take office, they were starting to ask questions.
One state that may offer a view of their future is neighboring Indiana. There, Gov. Mike Pence, also a Republican, agreed to expand Medicaid to people earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level, but only after winning federal permission to impose requirements on recipients that go well beyond the program’s normal rules.

Most significant, Indiana requires enrollees with incomes above the poverty level to make monthly payments, averaging about $11, toward their coverage. If they stop making these payments, they can lose dental and vision coverage or even be dropped from Medicaid temporarily.

For now, Kentuckians on Medicaid owe nothing for their coverage except minimal co-payments, typically $1 to $4, for certain drugs and services. But Mr. Bevin has repeatedly pointed to Indiana as an example of how Medicaid should work.

Mr. Jefferson, who works temporary jobs for minimum wage and has fallen into homelessness twice over the last two years, said his ability to pay would depend on how much work he could find and whether his chronic pain from working as a mover when he was younger would get in the way. He said he might be able to afford $30 a month.

“When I do find work, you’re talking roughly 50-some dollars a day,” Mr. Jefferson said. “But maybe, maybe I could do it.”

Mr. Osborne, who suffers from chronic pain from a series of on-the-job falls, said he had not worked recently because of a diagnosis of bladder cancer last year. But he had an offer from a boatbuilding company, and had come to ask for a doctor’s note attesting that he could perform the work. Medicaid, he said, had saved his life when he used it for kidney stones care last year and the doctor found bladder cancer.

“It didn’t cost me a dime — the specialists, the hospitals, the surgery,” he said. “And at the time — no money, no job, no nothing — I couldn’t ask for better.”

Although Mr. Bevin has softened his tone on the expanded Medicaid program, he has continued to say that the expansion as it stands now is unaffordable. The federal government is paying the full cost through next year, but Kentucky will have to start bearing a small share of it in 2017, growing to 10 percent by 2020.

The administration of his Democratic predecessor, Steven L. Beshear, has estimated that Kentucky’s cost of covering the new Medicaid enrollees will start at $74 million in 2017 and grow to $363 million by 2021. But Mr. Bevin has called those estimates, from a state-commissioned report by Deloitte Consulting, “nonsense.” He has also dismissed Deloitte’s finding that the expense of covering the new enrollees would be more than offset by the positive economic effects of expanding Medicaid.

For Bill Wagner, the chief executive of Family Health Centers, Mr. Bevin’s election was “a blow to the gut.” The number of uninsured patients at the organization’s seven clinics had dropped to 17 percent, he said, from 51 percent in 2013. While better than a complete repeal of the Medicaid expansion, the Indiana model might lead to financially fragile people losing coverage, Mr. Wagner said. Several studies have shown that charging premiums to Medicaid recipients leads to declines in enrollment.

While Mr. Bevin did not win Louisville, a Democratic stronghold, Mr. Conway did not win by nearly as big a margin here as Democrats usually do. William Benton, a Family Health Centers patient who voted for Mr. Conway, said he was not an inspiring candidate even for committed Democrats.

“A lot of people felt really justified not voting,” said Mr. Benton, a musician and part-time bakery worker who signed up for Medicaid this month to get help for his depression.
And in a state where approval of President Obama hovers around 34 percent, enthusiasm for the health law is lacking even among some who stand to benefit from it. Rick Prario, 54, learned at Family Health Centers this month that he was eligible for Medicaid after losing his longtime job at a hardware store. But he was still furious about having to pay the law’s tax penalty for going uninsured in 2014, when he was still working.

“They could take Obamacare and get rid of it, and it would never bother me one bit,” said Mr. Prario, who had been skipping treatment for diabetes, high blood pressure and arthritis.

Mr. Prario, who did not vote in the election, said he hoped to qualify for disability soon because he saw it as a surer thing than Medicaid.

At another Family Health Centers clinic, Laura Miles, 49, was trying to sign up her husband for a subsidized private plan through Kentucky’s online insurance exchange, and hating the law more with each passing minute. Her problem was a glitch that barred her husband from getting premium subsidies because the law considers her employer-sponsored insurance affordable. But adding her husband, a salvage yard worker with debilitating headaches, to that plan would bring her portion of the cost to $650 a month — impossibly expensive, Mrs. Miles said.

“It’s not fair, and it’s not right,” said Mrs. Miles, a Democrat who voted for Mr. Bevin.

Such sentiments are familiar to Mr. Osborne. He said he knew a lot of people who despise the Affordable Care Act because they have to pay for their health insurance and resent people getting it for free. Having been on both sides, he has a different view.

“When I go back to work and have to pay something for my insurance, I won’t holler and pout about it,” he said. “I’ll remember the time this government insurance saved my life.”
There is no one in music quite like Adele.

While stars are now expected to live their lives in full self-promotion mode online, Adele barely touches her social media accounts. A 27-year-old mother who speaks with a working-class North London accent, she is revered by fans as much for her seeming approachability as for her vocal prowess. In interviews she speaks about being a full-figured woman in the image-obsessed entertainment industry, and about rejecting product endorsements to keep the focus on her music.

She also sells more albums than anyone in the struggling music business thought was still possible.

When official sales numbers are announced by Nielsen on Monday, they are expected to show that Adele’s new album, “25,” which went on sale Nov. 20, will have sold at least 3.2 million copies in the United States in its first week. That smashes an opening-week sales record that has stood since ’N Sync sold 2.4 million copies of “No Strings Attached” in 2000. But annual CD sales then were more than five times what they are now, and the music industry relied on a vast network of brick-and-mortar retailers that has long since eroded.

“This is beyond all expectations,” said Ish Cuebas, vice president for music merchandising at Trans World Entertainment, whose more than 300 stores include the F.Y.E. chain.

Since 1991, when SoundScan — a tracking service now owned by Nielsen — began collecting reliable sales data from retailers, only 20 albums have sold more than a million copies in a week. Three Taylor Swift albums accomplished that feat, though none had sales that approached the stratospheric figures for “25.” Target and Barnes & Noble both said that first-day sales for “25” at their stores exceeded those of any previous album.

Adele’s “25” also had the biggest opening week in Britain, where just over 800,000 albums were sold, according to the Official Charts Company there. That beat a record set in 1997 by Oasis, which sold 696,000 copies of “Be Here Now” in an abbreviated three-day sales week.

With positive reviews, a hit song — “Hello,” already the subject of a “Saturday Night Live” sketch — and saturation coverage of Adele from an adoring news media, the album should remain a hit through the holiday season. Analysts expect it to sell five million copies or more in the United States by the end of the year, a milestone that has not been reached since 2011. That hot-selling album was Adele’s previous release, “21,” another trend-defying phenomenon that went on to sell about 30 million copies around the world.

On Thursday, Adele announced that she would go on tour in the spring for the first time in five years, all but guaranteeing heavy promotion for the album well into 2016, and perhaps beyond.
Adele’s “25” — filled with confessional torch songs and heart-tugging ballads, and driven by Adele’s powerful and soulful voice — is being celebrated throughout the music world as an artistic and commercial success that has become all too rare. And huge numbers of listeners who otherwise have spent little or no money on music are plunking down $10 or more for the album.

“There are people out there for whom this may be the only record they’ve bought in five years,” said David Bakula, a senior analyst at Nielsen. “The last one may have been ‘21,’ and now they’re coming back in force.”

The success of Adele’s “25” is all the more remarkable given how the landscape of music retail has changed since 2000, when some 700 million CDs were sold annually through a network of chains like Tower, Sam Goody and HMV, as well as in big-box stores like Best Buy and Circuit City that devoted considerable floor space to music. Today, with digital outlets like iTunes, Amazon and Spotify having upended the way that music is distributed and consumed, thousands of record stores across the country have closed and the music acreage at the big boxes has been sharply reduced. Last year just 141 million CDs were sold in the United States, according to Nielsen. An additional 106 million albums were sold as downloads.

But Adele appears to have activated millions of customers for whom making a purchase is viewed as a sign of devotion and support for the artist they love.

“There’s a level of respect by buying the song, rather than just streaming it,” said one fan, Carlos Villa. “I acknowledge the work that you put into this song, and I appreciate you for that.”

Mr. Villa, a 29-year-old who works as an administrator at New York University, said that he placed an advance order for “25” as soon as it became available on iTunes, and also ordered a CD from Amazon. He would have also bought a vinyl LP, he said, “but I don’t have one of those players.”

The album has also heightened the industry’s debate over streaming, since, like Ms. Swift a year ago, Adele decided to withhold her full album from streaming outlets like Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer, although “Hello” was widely available for streaming.

In an interview on NBC’s “Today” show on Wednesday, Adele hinted at the reason for releasing the single but not the album that way, saying that she viewed streaming sites as being like radio — in other words, as primarily a promotional platform. When Ms. Swift kept her latest album, “1989,” from Spotify and other streaming outlets last year, she criticized those sites as being part of a “grand experiment” that does not compensate musicians fairly. (Ms. Swift later made a deal with Apple to include “1989” on its new streaming service, Apple Music. Apple Music, unlike Spotify, does not have a free version, although Apple lets people try the service for three months without paying.)

The sales of “25” are being hailed as a vindication of Adele’s strategy to block the full album from streaming, although analysts have also been quick to portray her as an outlier whose success — or stance on streaming — is not likely to be repeated by very many acts. The No. 1 title on Billboard’s most recent album chart is Justin Bieber’s “Purpose,” which opened with a record 100 million streams, and other young stars like Ed Sheeran have expressed gratitude to Spotify for helping to propel their careers.

Retailers report that the album has been bought by all sorts of consumers — male, female, old and young.

But Adele’s success may also be because of her following among a demographic group that the youth-obsessed pop music world does not often focus on. According to Nielsen, which has studied the demographics of the fans of various pop acts, the typical Adele fan is a college-educated woman aged 25 to 44, who watches “Family Guy” on TV and likes to shop at Target, Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works.

Opening-week sales for Adele’s “25” are expected to be split almost evenly between digital downloads and CDs. ITunes represents the majority of digital copies and Target is the biggest driver of physical sales. The retailer had a special version of the album with three bonus songs, ran TV commercials promoting the release and placed cardboard displays filled with the CD by checkout lines.

“It’s something to celebrate, and miraculous to watch,” Russ Crupnick, an analyst with the market research firm MusicWatch, said of Adele’s sales. “But I think it’s like 75 home runs: It’s probably going to be a long time before we see one like that again.”
The silver-haired man dressed like a waiter (dark vest, dark slacks) paced the aisle between rows of desks in a Toronto conference room. “If you’re going to be a leader, you’re going to have to have a very loose relationship with this thing you call ‘I’ or ‘me,’” he shouted. “Maybe that whole thing in me around which the universe revolves isn’t so central!”

He paused to wipe his brow with a wad of paper towels. An assistant stood by with a microphone, but he waved her off. “Maybe life is not about the self but about self-transcendence! You got a problem with that?”

No one in the room had a problem with that. The desks were occupied by 27 name-tagged academics from around the world. And in the course of the day, a number of them would take the mike to pose what their instructor referred to as “yeah buts, how ’bouts or what ifs” in response to his pronouncements — but no one had a problem with them.

In some ways, the three-day workshop, “Creating Class Leaders,” recalled an EST training session. As with that cultural touchstone of the 1970s, there was “sharing” and applause. There were confrontations and hugs. Gnomic declarations hovered in the air like mist: “We need to distinguish distinction”; “There’s no seeing, there’s only the seer”; “There isn’t any is.”

But the event was much more civilized than EST. There were bathroom breaks. No one was called an expletive by the teacher.

This is significant because the teacher was none other than the creator of EST, Werner Erhard.

Pound another nail into the coffin for F. Scott Fitzgerald’s notion that there are no second acts in American lives.

“I am committed to the opposite of that idea,” Mr. Erhard said a few weeks after the leadership class in Toronto. “I don’t think there’s a person who walked out of that room who isn’t a second act.” To say nothing of their instructor, who, at age 80, may be more of a third or fourth act.

There was a time, boys and girls — the Me Decade, Tom Wolfe called it — when Mom and Dad wore mood rings, attended encounter groups and in general engaged in a tireless amount of navel gazing. If the so-called human potential movement had a single avatar, it was Werner Erhard.

EST (Latin for “is” and an acronym for Erhard Seminars Training) was equal parts Zen Buddhism and Dale Carnegie. Aspiring “ESTies” flocked to hotel ballrooms across the country for combative training sessions during which they forwent meal and bathroom breaks to take responsibility for their lives and “get it” by discovering there was nothing to get.

Diana Ross, Joe Namath, Yoko Ono, Jerry Rubin and several hundred thousand other seekers got it. Newsweek anointed Mr. Erhard “a celebrity guru who retails enlightenment.” There were doubters. To New Times magazine, he was “the king of the brain snatchers.”

The criticism intensified as EST grew. It was labeled a cult that practiced mind control (verbal abuse, sleep deprivation), a racket that exploited its followers (heavy recruiting, endless “graduate seminars”).

Much was made of Mr. Erhard’s tangled Don Draperish past: his days as a car salesman in Philadelphia, his dabbling in Mind Dynamics and Scientology, his desertion of his first wife and their four children to reinvent himself on the West Coast.

Even his name was fake, lifted from an Esquire article he read on the plane to California. (“The Men Who Made the New Germany” included references to Ludwig Erhard, the minister of economics, and Werner Heisenberg, the atomic scientist.) Mr. Erhard was born Jack Rosenberg.

In 1985, he repackaged EST as the Forum, a kinder, gentler iteration of the training that was also more success-oriented. “In the ’80s, people started to think a little bit, and it was possible to use a less-confrontational style,” he said. But tax disputes, company lawsuits and an ugly divorce from his second wife kept Mr. Erhard in the news media cross hairs.

The flameout came in 1991. In March of that year, at the same time that I.R.S. officials were publicly accusing him of tax fraud, “60 Minutes” broadcast a report on Mr. Erhard that depicted him as an abusive father and husband who had sexually molested two daughters from his second marriage. Shortly before that show was televised, he sold the Forum to a group of employees, gave his Great Dane to a friend and fled the country.

“My reputation was destroyed by ‘60 Minutes,’” Mr. Erhard shouted between sips of Dragon Well Supreme green tea and a fistful of the pills he takes for various ailments. (He has no indoor voice — a professional hazard, perhaps.)

He had taken a suite at the London NYC hotel, where he had traveled with his Dutch-born third wife, Gonneke Spits, from Toronto to see friends, do a little business and visit his favorite chiropractor and tailor. He was also in the city to meet with a reporter — virtually the only press he has done in more than two decades.

“It was clear that I had to remove myself from the work, or the work was going to get very damaged,” Mr. Erhard said of his self-imposed exile.
But it was the Church of Scientology that actually drove him out of the country. According to Mr. Erhard, the “60 Minutes” allegations were the culmination of a smear campaign organized by Scientology officials to get back at him for poaching clients and ideas.

“There’s no question that I was declared fair game by L. Ron Hubbard,” he said. “In the doctrines of Scientology, that meant they could destroy me financially, socially or reputationally.”

This was a long time before the book (and the movie) “Going Clear” exposed some of the shadier practices of Scientology. But a 1991 article in The Los Angeles Times described how the church had indeed targeted Mr. Erhard as a “suppressive person,” hiring at least three private investigators to dig up dirt on him and pass it on to the news media. One of them, Alan Clow, said he shared his findings with “60 Minutes.”

As for the I.R.S., Mr. Erhard sued the agency (winning $200,000 in damages) for falsely claiming he had evaded taxes.

The daughter who had accused him of abuse later recanted, admitting she had lied to receive an advance on a book. And an article in The Believer stated that the “60 Minutes” segment was riddled with so many discrepancies that CBS deleted it from its public archives.

After leaving the country, Mr. Erhard settled in a friend’s apartment in Tokyo, with, he said, no more than “a pocketful of cash” to his name.

He had kept the business rights to the Forum in Japan, and for several years, under the rubric of “mastery,” he conducted seminars for professionals coping with Japan’s financial crisis of the early 1990s. He also did some consulting work for Landmark, the Forum’s successor, run by his brother Harry Rosenberg.

In 1996, Mr. Erhard came down with a mysterious debilitating illness. A friend referred him to his doctor in the Cayman Islands, who ultimately diagnosed the Epstein-Barr virus. Mr. Erhard recovered on Grand Cayman, where he and Ms. Spits (a former EST executive) bought a villa in George Town, which remains their home base when they are not traveling.

For several years before his latest professional reincarnation, Mr. Erhard consulted for businesses and government agencies like the Russian adult-education program the Znaniye Society and a nonprofit organization supporting clergy in Ireland.

Enter the Harvard economist Michael Jensen. Dr. Jensen, who is famous in financial circles for championing the concepts of shareholder value and executive stock options, had taken a Landmark course in Boston at the suggestion of his daughter, who mended a rocky relationship with Dr. Jensen after taking the course herself.

“I became convinced we should work to get this kind of transformational material into the academies,” he said, adding that he considers Mr. Erhard “one of the great intellectuals of the century.”

In 2004, with the help of a Landmark official, Dr. Jensen developed an experiential course on integrity in leadership at the Simon Business School at the University of Rochester. The class was offered there for five years, with Mr. Erhard signing on as an instructor during its third year. It has since been taught at several universities around the world as well as at the United States Air Force Academy.

As far as its philosophical underpinnings go, Mr. Erhard struggled a bit to describe the course without resorting to its Delphic phraseology (“ontological pedagogy,” “action as a correlate of the occurring”).

Sitting in front of a bank of computers in his hotel room, he read excerpts from the 1,000-page textbook he is working on, such as: “As linguistic abstractions, leader and leadership create leader and leadership as realms of possibility in which, when you are being a leader, all possible ways of being are available to you.”

Briefly, the course, which owes ideological debts to the Forum and to the German philosopher Martin Heidegger, takes an experience-based, rather than knowledge-based, approach to its subject. Students master principles like integrity and authenticity in order to leave the class acting as leaders instead of merely knowing about leadership.
Its promoters believe the course has broader applications both within and outside of academia. “They should take it to government,” said Paul Fireman, the former chairman and C.E.O. of Reebok, who has consulted with Mr. Erhard on his recent work. (Mr. Fireman says that Reebok’s stock price jumped “from the $6 or $7 range to the $25 to $30 range” after he introduced his employees to the Landmark training.)

Landmark, for which Mr. Erhard continues to help develop new programs, is far more mainstream than EST ever became. Currently, according to Harry Rosenberg, 130,000 people a year participate in its offerings, which are available on every continent except Antarctica. It has a stronger corporate presence than EST or the Forum; in addition to Reebok, clients include Microsoft, NASA and Lululemon.

Still, Mr. Erhard’s emphasis on personal responsibility, on being rather than knowing, is embedded in the Landmark workshops. “All of the Landmark programs are based on the ideas and methodology that Werner developed,” Mr. Rosenberg said. “The basic intent has not changed.”

In fact, Mr. Erhard casts a fairly long shadow in the culture at large. His influence, wrote Lucy Kellaway in the Financial Times, “extends far beyond the couple of million people who have done his courses: there is hardly a self-help book or a management training programme that does not borrow some of his principles.”

Whether that’s a good thing or not probably depends on one’s attitude toward such books and programs.

“Erhard made palatable the notion that the end justifies the means,” said Steve Salerno, the author of “Sham: How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless.” “Which is partly responsible for the climate of what I call happyism. If your happiness is all that matters, anybody who stands in the way becomes detritus in the ruthless pursuit of individual perfection.”

Criticism of this sort does not faze Mr. Erhard. Certainly, he’s weathered worse.

In his ninth decade, he is consumed with his latest mission, putting in 10-hour days lecturing and teaching three courses a year in addition to completing the textbook.

His recent health challenges include a battle with septicemia that left him having to learn to walk again (a timer in his suite reminded him to stroll around every half-hour), but he still works six days a week.

While he writes, he listens to music: Renée Fleming, the Serbian composer Stevan Mokranjac, Sérgio Mendes. “You’re going to get a kick out of this,” he said, scrolling through the playlist on one of his computers. “Gonneke! Where’s ‘Brasileiro’ on here?”

His wife, a stylish platinum-haired woman whom Mr. Erhard leans on to negotiate the more mundane demands of life, helped him find the album by Mr. Mendes in question. The surdo-drum thumping of a batucada band filled the room.

In their downtime, the couple likes to travel. Tokyo, Amsterdam and London are favorite places, along with Hawaii and the West Coast, where Mr. Erhard’s seven children live. He now enjoys a very strong relationship with four of them, he said, and a good relationship with the other three.

He also has 11 grandchildren, and one of his current preoccupations is the numbing effects of digital technology on millennials. Warming to the subject, he read aloud another passage, this one from a dense Heidegger essay calling for a “comportment toward technology which expresses yes and at the same time no.”

”The cost to this generation is enormous,” Mr. Erhard said. “They are losing access to their humanity.”

Maintaining access to his own humanity may be Mr. Erhard’s biggest project. Floating around the screen of another computer was the word “impeccability,” a reminder, he said, “to deal with whatever I touch with care.” If he learned his lesson the hard way, maybe there is no easy way.

“Here’s how it is for me,” Mr. Erhard said, leaning in, giving his vocal chords a break. “When my integrity is lacking, I am clear that I just got to be a bit smaller as a person. And the thing you have to remember about integrity is it’s a mountain with no top.”

The clock chimed. He stood and stretched. Time for another few laps around the room.
The text exchange was unspectacular: a friend explaining a video that had been posted by a classmate to his Snapchat feed. Jordana Narin, my 20-year-old research assistant, was half paying attention, sitting in my living room working on a project, texting between breaks.

“Omg literally dying,” she typed back, not missing a beat. She turned back to her computer.

But Jordana wasn’t literally dying. She wasn’t figuratively dying, either. In fact, she didn’t even crack a smile.

“I don’t even know what she’s talking about,” she told me when I asked. “I want to be like, ‘I don’t care.’”

But instead, she typed what to some may seem like the most dramatic response imaginable. Except that it wasn’t.

“It’s almost like ‘dying’ has become a filler for anytime anyone says anything remotely entertaining,” she said. “Like, if what you’re saying won’t legitimately put me to sleep, I respond with, ‘OMG dying.’”

R.I.P. to the understatement. Welcome to death by Internet hyperbole, the latest example of the overly dramatic, forcibly emotive, truncated, simplistic and frequently absurd ways chosen to express emotion in the Internet age (or sometimes feign it).

Other examples: THIS (for when a thing is so awesome you are at a loss for how to describe it); feeeeeels (for something that gives you multiple feelings); unreal!!!! (for when a thing is totally believable and only mildly amusing); yassssss (because “yes” will no longer do); -est (greatest, prettiest, cutest, funniest) EVER, which now applies to virtually all things; and “I can’t even,” for when something leaves you so emotive that you simply cannot even explain yourself.

There’s also a;lsdkjfa;lsdkgjs; meaning “I’m so excited/angry/speechless that all I can do is literally slam my hands/head/body against the keyboard” (thus producing a series of gibberish that usually involves the letters a, s, d and k).

“I use ‘I can’t even’ whenever I talk about babies or puppies, or sometimes couples, but not like couples our age, but older couples like my parents,” said Sharon Attia, my other 20-year-old researcher, a photojournalism student at New York University.

Other members of the “I can’t even” advisory system, she said, include: “I can’t,” “I just can’t even,” “I cannot,” “I literally cannot” and “I have lost the ability to even,” each of which can be used interchangeably to express hilarity, excitement, embarrassment, that something’s cute, that something’s hideous, or just that you’re freaking out.

But hyperbolic death is perhaps its own linguistic category, with recent causes that include (at least according to my Facebook feed): Beyonce’s Instagram (“dyyying”); a video of a huskie looking shocked when his owner wouldn’t give him the last bite of his food (“*dead*”); and Hillary Clinton, who was captured in a GIF brushing off the shoulder of her blazer during the 11-hour Benghazi hearings (“This is the best thing to ever have happened”).

Eternal rest can also take the form of “dying” (death in process), “not breathing” (first sign of possible death), “all the way dead,” “actually dead” and “literally dead” (just so you know), as well as “literally bye” (for when you’re about to die), “ded” (when you are dying so fast that typing an “a” would delay the entire process) and “RIP me” (after you’ve had a moment to process it). There’s also kms, or “killing myself,” which, as 15-year-old Ruby Karp, a high school student in Manhattan, explained it, can be used to say something like “ugh so much homework kms!”

In Jordana’s case, “dying” or “dead” had been used in recent conversations to respond to:

A friend drunk-texting.

Seeing a Dane Cook look-alike and his dog on the street.

An unlikely romantic pairing.

A friend live-tweeting “50 Shades of Grey” (so good she was “dying AND dead”).

How good an article was.

Hearing an author she admired speak (“omg actually dying”).

Eating Pringles in bed.

“‘Literally dying’ has become, like, the new LOL,” she said, referring to the acronym for “laugh out loud,” which, of course, if you know literally anything about Internet speech, means precisely the opposite.

The trend toward hyperbole appears to echo a broader belief among experts that young women are its first adopters. Studies have shown that women tend to be more expressive, using more personal pronouns, more emotive words, more abbreviations like LOL, as well as creative punctuation, emoji and even more descriptive hashtags.

But such speech is not limited to them. “I can’t even” has been around for at least a few decades, part of a linguistic concept known as “negative polarity,” when there are two negatives in a sentence. The use of “literally” in situations where “figuratively” would fit perfectly — you know, it was literally 100 degrees just last week — has been in use since at least the 1700s, said Jane Solomon, a lexicographer at Dictionary.com. And hyperbole is in some ways necessary, as the impact of certain words erodes with time. (Think of how “great” used to mean really great, like Catherine the Great great, whereas now it’s hardly better than “good.”)

The Internet has taken all these speech patterns and hit them with a dose of caffeine: the need to express emotion in bite-size, 140-character bits; the fact that we must come up with increasingly creative ways to express tone and emphasis when facial cues are not an option. There’s a performative element, too: We are expressing things with an audience in mind.

“I think this may be one of the major parts for social media; you are stepping onto a stage,” said Tyler Schnoebelen, a linguist and founder of Idibon, a company that uses computer data to analyze language. “Performance generally requires the performer to be interesting. So do likes, comments and reshares. Exaggeration is one way to do that.”

And so it is, then, that a member of the boy band One Direction shows off his pecs onstage, and girls on Tumblr coo that their “ovaries are exploding.” That when the pop star Taylor Swift hosts a series of surprise listening parties for a new album, her fans respond that “My poor heart could not keep up,” “call me an ambulance,” “we all died” and “I literally had to plan my funeral arrangements cause I wasn’t going to make it.” Even editors do it, writing headlines that declare “This rapper will restore your faith in humanity” (really? Will he?) or that you “need to drop everything and watch this.” Yes, it’s as if we speak in click-bait now, every response more dramatic than the last.

Yet if a bacon-flavored ice cream sundae gives you all the “feels ever,” or you are “dead” over a cute cat photo, how do you respond if something is actually dramatic?

One idea is to play dead. That’s the concept behind @omgliterallydead, an Instagram account that features a skeleton (“Skellie”) engaging in everyday activities: drinking a pumpkin-spice latte, relaxing in a sauna; out for sushi. Skellie is a play on death, clearly, yet when I mentioned him to a college student I know, she responded: “Skellie is LIFE!!!!” (What’s more dramatic than being six feet under, rolling in your grave, actual skeleton dead? “The afterlife, obviously,” joked Gretchen McCulloch, a linguist.)

Or, if you’re Madison Jones, Ms. Narin’s roommate who recently responded “dead” to a baby picture her father had texted her, you prompt a family-wide panic about the state of your health.

“What?? Dead what??” her dad texted. “Maddy?”

“Dad I’m fine holy cow!” she replied. “Dead at that pic cause it’s rly cute!!!”
MIAMI BEACH — It seemed like the perfect night life accessory for the South Beach set — an automated robotic parking garage where trendy clubgoers could park their Porsches with a futuristic touch of a button.

Forget hiding your GPS and favorite Fendi sunglasses from a valet who might ding your new alloy wheels; this garage would park cars itself.

Instead, malfunctions lasted for hours. Cars were smashed, and faulty machinery fell several stories to the ground. Sometimes vehicles were stuck for so long that garage operators had to pay for customers’ taxis.

“It was clear that the garage was not ready to be open to the public,” said Russell Galbut, the managing principal at Crescent Heights, the property developer, which has sued two manufacturers over the botched garage.

    Big Deal: Automated Parking Garages For the Car-ObsessedMARCH 1, 2013

While engineers aim to perfect self-driving cars, they still have a lot of work to do on another element of the idealized commute of the future: robotic parking. Designs differ, but most consist of a combination of automated ramps, slabs, lifts and shelves, using a computerized system that parks and delivers a car like a high-tech vending machine.
But the garage on Collins Avenue is one of two cutting-edge parking projects in South Florida that ended in spectacular debacles. At a luxury residential high-rise in downtown Miami, a $16 million robotic garage plagued with delays finally closed, leaving tenants paying $28 a day to park elsewhere. The police were called to keep order at the building, BrickellHouse.

And around the country, other attempts at self-parking garages have been caught in embarrassing software and hardware mishaps at a time when dozens of projects have been proposed or are underway.

High-tech parking is common in Europe, in the Middle East and elsewhere in Asia, where space limitations made it a priority. But in the United States, errors were common because drivers were unaccustomed to the technology, and some garage builders tried to duplicate foreign successes without understanding how differences in design can make or break a project.

Some smaller garages work fine, but others designed to whiz automobiles away and return them in three minutes or less are bringing back the wrong cars, trapping vehicles, taking what feels like forever and even damaging automobiles.

Local laws and trends in green building are now demanding that developers find more efficient ways to use space, including parking. But it can be more easily mandated than achieved. Already the company that built the two unsuccessful South Florida garages, Boomerang Systems, declared bankruptcy this summer and last week announced that the company would voluntarily liquidate its assets.

In Hoboken, N.J., where the country’s first robotic garage was built over a decade ago, a Cadillac plunged six stories, and a Jeep dropped four stories a year later. One of the country’s largest automated parking garages, in Maryland, is now closed after an employee fell to his death in an accident that led to more than $1 million in required repairs.

“On the weekends, it usually takes 45 minutes to an hour to get your car,” said Aldo Ferri, 36, an Audi driver who rents an apartment at BrickellHouse, a building that looks out on Biscayne Bay. “You can only have X number of cars delivered versus requested. If the numbers go high, the system goes crazy.”

In Miami, where public transportation is notoriously lacking, too many people were trying to leave for work at the same time.
After months of problems, the condominium association was forced to hire old-fashioned valets to park cars for people who needed them quickly. This month, the feud with the garage builder deteriorated further and access to the garage was blocked off.

“I’m going to move out,” Mr. Ferri said.

The BrickellHouse condo association declined to comment. The building developer, Harvey Hernandez, and Boomerang Services —who have pending litigation against each other on financing matters — did not respond to requests for comment.

According to Boomerang’s website, the company has seven robotic parking projects. The website does not mention the Collins Avenue garage, built for 139 cars, which has sat unused for five years. Photographs provided by the developer, who successfully sued Boomerang, show cars dangling off platforms and squashed in shafts.

The developer hired another robotic parking company, Park Plus, to make fixes, but in late October that attempt landed in court as well; the dispute is not yet resolved.

Even with the repairs, test runs show the Collins Avenue garage takes about seven minutes to retrieve cars. It is supposed to take three. Instead of turning around 60 cars an hour, the garage can handle only 16, the company said.

“For some reason in the U.S., we don’t seem to be able to successfully perform this task,” said Ron Lowy, a Miami lawyer who sued two parking companies on behalf of Crescent Heights. “Once you start exceeding 100 cars, it starts being a major issue with the technology itself.” He said the company has now spent some $10 million on the unused garage.

Ryan Astrup, the director of Park Plus, said some garage designs just could not handle the traffic, creating a bottleneck.
“You can’t have automated parking at Yankee Stadium and expect it to deliver,” Mr. Astrup said.

He added that drivers generate many of the delays by doing things like walking away without pushing a button to tell the garage to park their car, which jams the system for everyone else.

“Americans are not used to this method of parking,” said Mr. Astrup, who is from South Africa and has developed successful robotic parking garages in New York. “On the one hand, it is exciting. On the other hand, it can be confusing or overwhelming.”

Mr. Astrup said he could not discuss details of the project because of pending litigation, but asserted that his company had fixed the garage, although he acknowledged that cars take at least six minutes to be returned to their drivers, double the target.

Despite the setbacks, parking industry experts say automated parking is here to stay.

“It’s unfortunate that you’ve got projects that haven’t happened the way that they were supposed to, because it gives the entire industry a black eye when it shouldn’t, because automated parking is a wave of parking for the future,” said Christopher Alan, whose company, Auto Parkit, has seven such garages and 20 more under construction, mostly in California. “You don’t have a lot companies that are doing this. A few do it very well.”

Mr. Alan said his key to success was designing simpler technology, which allowed him to park 200 cars where a traditional garage can fit 100.

Another South Florida developer, Gil Dezer, said his new high-rise in Sunny Isles, the Porsche Design Tower, would feature an automated garage that would deliver a car right to a resident’s door. He called it the Dezervator.

“Ours is an elevator,” Mr. Dezer said. “An elevator goes up and down. We know how to use an elevator.”

Casey Jones, a former chairman of the International Parking Institute, said industry leaders believe the kinks will be worked out. They have to: Developers cannot keep paving over land for people to park their cars on, he said.

“The technology is there,” Mr. Jones said. “We have elevators, and the concept is the same. Elevators move people. In robotic parking, those elevators move cars. Whether it’s now or two or three decades from now, we need to continue to pursue it and hone that innovation.”
Maisha Stephens-Teacher opened her hair salon, Bibi, on Frederick Douglass Boulevard five years ago. “I’ve done this for 27 years,” she said. “My salon uses high-end products. Our stylists are very talented, but I couldn’t command prices commensurate with that. People would say, ‘Well, I can pay that downtown.’”

But in the last year, the neighborhood’s beauty landscape has begun to change. Just five blocks from Bibi, Seven Brown owns a bustling skin-care and laser hair-removal clinic. Right across the street, Alita Terry does customized organic facials. Such services were, until recently, either scarce or altogether unavailable in Harlem. “This burst of activity has been insane,” Ms. Stephens-Teacher said. And, she added, people are starting to appreciate and support the businesses. Here, portraits of Harlem’s new beauty.


Options for the Harlem beauty shopper have historically been limited: either navigate cluttered beauty-supply-store aisles or hit the local drugstore. Desiree Verdejo, a former lawyer, has made a difference. “Uptown deserved a better shopping experience,” she said.

Ms. Verdejo’s minimalist space manages to feel spalike without being sterile. But the real magic is in her editing. The eclectic mix of luxury and accessible brands makes shopping at Vivrant feel like discovery. “When I’m picking brands, if something is already too available in the neighborhood, then it doesn’t make sense here,” she said.

The Italian hair-care line Davines shares space with Soultanicals, a natural-hair-care line out of Brooklyn. The presence of premium skin-care lines like Ren, Ahava and Indie Lee may be Vivrant’s biggest coup. The entire category had been noticeably absent from the neighborhood.

Ms. Verdejo also stocks products from local artisans. “There are so many amazing black-owned lines that should be on the shelves of major retailers but aren’t,” she said. “I now have an opportunity to give exposure to them.”



Back when the weather was balmy, the aesthetician Alita Terry would sit outside her neighborhood coffee shop, studying books on the skin-care properties of plants. “Many ingredients in conventional beauty products are synthetic versions of an herb or extract,” Ms. Terry said. “Why buy synthetic when you can just go to the farmers’ market and get the real thing?”

Ms. Terry opened Ethereal Aromatherapy and Skin Care in July. During her 45- and 75-minute facials ($55 and $95), she mixes organic essential oils, clays and plant waters, customizing each treatment to the client’s needs. A 20-something student with a mild case of acne received a clay mask with bearberry extract, which is said to have an antibacterial effect, and a frankincense oil facial massage.

“First, I do a skin analysis,” Ms. Terry said. “I’m deciding what actives will help you, then I formulate the skin care right there.” Her facials are not lie-down-and-doze-off experiences. The goal is that a client leaves with a better understanding of her skin’s needs — and a maintenance routine. “When I worked for other people, I’d always get called out for going over my time,” she said. “But I love to talk, and educating my clients about their skin is top priority.”



When Fumi Sueyoshi left her job as a manicurist at Carol’s Daughter on 125th Street, she saw an opportunity. “I lived and worked in Harlem, so I knew the neighborhood well,” she said. “There was no other nail salon doing this kind of intricate nail art. My competition was all downtown.”

Ms. Sueyoshi’s salon, Fumic Jewelry Nails, opened last December. It specializes in Japanese nail art, which she says is especially detailed and uniquely embellished. One elaborate manicure mixed metallic gold stripes and appliqués with crystals and Bordeaux gel polish. But some designs are understated.

“We take the time to develop an idea that is unique to each client,” Ms. Sueyoshi said. Solid-color gel manicures are $50, while custom nail art starts at $20 a nail. The space is cozy; “French country shabby chic,” she calls it. She made the pedicure benches herself and hand-distressed the paint on the reception desk. “Our services take time, so I wanted this to be a place where people could relax,” she said.


A year ago, Seven Brown was running a small skin-care practice. She had always been more in love with teaching aesthetics than practicing and was in no rush to expand. “But then a good friend said, ‘You need to do more,’” she said. As it turned out, getting her new space ready to open last April was a community affair.

“Our funding fell through, and the space sat vacant for months,” Ms. Brown said. “My contractor donated his services, my front-desk person’s father painted, friends did this and that. Without that camaraderie among business owners in the neighborhood, I don’t know if we’d all still be here.”

Services include laser hair removal, facials targeting specific concerns like acne and aging ($125 and up) and waxing. Though she is most obviously filling a need for a hair-removal spa in Harlem, Ms. Brown insists her true point of difference is client care. “For example, during a Brazilian bikini wax, we don’t flip and twist,” she said. “We want to practice mindful beauty — you never know what someone is going through.”
For those couples who like to exhibit their inner Michelangelo or Martha Stewart, weddings have become festivals of do-it-yourself creativity. But in the days leading up to the event, a couple’s desire for those artisanal touches can come at a cost in lost hours and increased anxiety.

Why does a fork rent for 57 cents a night? Do folding chairs work for hoisting the bride and groom during the hora? (No.) How do you scrub pigeon droppings from a brick aisle?

I worried about all this and more as I prepared for my daughter’s wedding. But figuring out the answers was nothing compared with what my daughter, Rachel Wood, an international health analyst at the Health and Human Services Department by day, was doing evenings and weekends at her Washington apartment.
Field Notes

In the months before the ceremony, she was designing a wedding website, invitations, programs, menus, table banners and (less arduously) signature drinks. A few days before her wedding, she spent hours building a seating chart imposed on a world map, an idea she lifted from, where else, Pinterest, the do-it-yourself mother ship. Besides putting her personal stamp on her wedding, all of her crafting saved us an estimated $10,000.

While some make their own food and vows, most confine their D.I.Y. skills to labor-intensive peripherals. On Pinterest, the more popular of these items are glitter tea lights, wax-paper lanterns, tissue-paper pompoms, Jenga guest books and felt peonies. And how many hours might those projects require for completion? If you have to ask, you probably don’t have enough time.

Buzzfeed (not necessarily helpfully) offers 36 ways to save the date, including paper cutouts, 3-D coded messages, movie posters, paper airplanes and temporary tattoos. Whatever you do, someone else is doing more. And doing it better.

“Pinterest sent me over the edge,” said Dara Matthews, who is studying to be a social worker. She married Jeremy Sklarsky, a computer coder, a year ago in the Hudson Valley. “It made me crazy. While it helped inspire some creative ideas, it also heightened my inferiority complex.”

Couples can acquire skills by taking wedding tutorials on woodworking, calligraphy, mixology and succulent terrariums. It helps if a bride and groom can wield a hot-glue gun, and value their leisure time at close to zero.

Ms. Matthews and Mr. Sklarsky gave up bike rides and beach visits to tint Mason jars (fun), tie-dye table runners (not fun) and make old 45 r.p.m. records into table numbers.

“D.I.Y. took more time and effort than we planned, and friends and family ended up helping out more than they anticipated,” Ms. Matthews said. “The ‘yourself’ in D.I.Y. means you and everyone you know who can help get it done. But everything turned out great.”

A 2014 survey of 15,000 couples conducted by the wedding-media company the Knot found that 87 percent had one or more D.I.Y. items, said Jamie Miles, managing editor of theknot.com.

As the cost of weddings rise, the number of couples turning to D.I.Y. is growing, said Darcy Miller, editorial director of Martha Stewart Weddings. There is an added benefit, she said: A couple can “make their wedding their own.”

Some go beyond Pinterest, building something uniquely theirs. Tom Kukla, an actuary, channeled his artistic skills in the months before his wedding to Lauren Coss, who works in children’s publishing. He carved two red-eyed wooden loons, the state bird, for the cake for the ceremony on Bay Lake, Minn.

Sculpture may not be in the do-it-yourself wheelhouse of every bride or groom. Michelle Edgemont, a Brooklyn-based wedding designer, recommends couples not try learning a new skill. Better, she said, to stick to something they already know.

Lindsay Scola, the director of external affairs for Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office of media and entertainment and a former advance woman for President Obama, knows how to organize. For the 2013 wedding of her sister, Mallory Selzo, a biomedical engineer at Siemens Medical, Ms. Scola divided friends and family into teams and handed out jobs.

Dr. Selzo designed her own ketubah (the traditional Jewish marriage contract), table flags, seat assignments and signage. Teams built a lace and PVC-pipe wedding canopy and cut pink tissue paper to make biodegradable confetti. D.I.Y. saved them money and had the unanticipated benefit of bonding family and friends, Ms. Scola said, “even if my mother would now like Pinterest removed from the Internet.”

The D.I.Y. movement is part of the larger personalization of all things. Ann Swidler, a University of California, Berkeley sociology professor and one of the authors of the book “Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Life,” suggests that older forms of status, like knowledge of opera or Renaissance paintings, have lost their cachet, while new ones, “based on asserting one’s uniqueness and creativity,” are emerging.

Some people, like Kameron Kitajima-Kimbrel, a community manager at Google, and Sam Kitajima-Kimbrel, a software developer with Twilio, spent a year preparing to make their event memorable. The two created a classic video-game wedding with Perler-bead video game characters and Super Mario’s Piranha Plant, and party favors out of succulents and Mason jars.

A relative made a Mario Bros. three-tiered cake to represent the overworld, underworld and underwater. In a two-day marathon, the couple and their family made 400 macarons of chocolate or green tea.

“I’m not sure I would recommend it to anyone,” Sam Kitajima-Kimbrel said. But he said they accomplished their objective: “We wanted to make sure that our personality and voice really came through in our work.”

My daughter and I wanted that, too. Friends and family who are professional photographers and videographers recorded Rachel’s wedding, which was held overlooking the San Francisco Bay. Art Agnos, a former mayor of San Francisco who is a friend, performed the ceremony. Guests danced to Diego’s Umbrella, a gypsy rock band whose wild drummer, Jake Wood, is my son and Rachel’s brother.

For the six months leading up to the wedding, my daughter said, “I was either occupied crafting things or preoccupied thinking I should be.”

After being together for 10 years, Lia Bleichfeld and Piper Kristensen married in August at the groom’s family home in Woodstock, Vt. The groom and his father and friends carted an old maple stump from the forest back to their home, where they hollowed it out with a chain saw, transforming the base into an outdoor beer and cider tap.

Guests were invited to arrive days before the wedding. “We had friends there for a whole week, cooking and prepping,” Ms. Bleichfeld said. Those that had salad duty “did not imagine they would be rolling up their sleeves and putting their arms elbow deep into two feet of quinoa,” she said, recalling them mixing in tomatoes, olives, feta, cucumber, parsley and red onion for the salad. “I think our guests felt they earned the celebration in the end.”

My daughter and her husband, Andrew Rakestraw, a negotiator for international climate change at the State Department, had been together for almost eight years. Because, like those of many other couples, their lives were long intertwined, she said the wedding “became less a coming together and more a celebration of who we are.”
“Your rational mind goes out the window,” she said. “Everyone says love isn’t rational. Maybe planning a wedding isn’t, either.”
“The Danish Girl,” Tom Hooper’s new film, is a story of individual struggle that is also a portrait of a marriage. In this respect and others it resembles “The King’s Speech,” Mr. Hooper’s earlier historical drama, a multiple Oscar winner a few years ago. In that case, the union of George VI and Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, was the foundation on which the tale of George’s elocutionary striving was built. Here, the marriage is bohemian rather than aristocratic, but the stakes, while personal, are every bit as profound and consequential as the matters of state that drove the monarch to the microphone.

    Tom Hooper Narrates a Scene From ‘The Danish Girl’NOV. 26, 2015

When we first encounter Gerda and Einar Wegener, played by Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne, they seem perfectly matched. Both are painters, living amid the soft colors and sea air of Copenhagen in 1926. Gerda is a portraitist, while Einar’s landscapes — drawn from his childhood memories of the fjords and marshlands of Vejle, a town on the Jutland peninsula — have brought him a measure of fame. Like many couples who share a profession, they provide each other with support as well as a bit of competition. Their best friend, Ulla (Amber Heard), a dancer, marvels at their mutual devotion, which combines the easy, egalitarian warmth of friendship with the heat of sexual attraction.
But their relationship turns out to rest on a false premise. Through a process that is by turns wrenching and exciting, Einar discovers that the man the world has always taken him to be is not the person he truly is. What begins as an experiment and a bit of a game — dressing as a woman for the Copenhagen artist’s ball, wearing one of Gerda’s camisoles under his clothes — becomes an existential transformation. For a while, Einar and Gerda pretend that Lili, his female persona, is Einar’s cousin, visiting Copenhagen from the countryside. Henrik (Ben Whishaw), a self-described “romantic,” falls in love with her. But Lili is not Einar in disguise: The truth is exactly the reverse.

Written for the screen by Lucinda Coxon and based on David Ebershoff’s novel of the same title, “The Danish Girl” is a fictionalized biography of Lili Elbe (as Einar Wegener came to be known), one of the first people to attempt sex reassignment surgery. Lili’s encounters with prevailing medical wisdom, culminating in her meeting with a sympathetic doctor (Sebastian Koch), form a harrowing subplot. And her bravery makes this film a welcome tribute to a heroic forerunner of the current movement for transgender rights. It’s impossible not to be moved by Lili’s self-recognition and by her demand to be recognized by those who care most about her.

But it’s also hard not to wish that “The Danish Girl” were a better movie, a more daring and emotionally open exploration of Lili’s emergence. As it is, the film, like its heroine for most of her life, is trapped by conventional expectations and ways of being. If, that is, Lili is really the heroine at all. The film’s title phrase is uttered on screen once, by Einar’s childhood friend Hans (Matthias Schoenaerts), a Paris art dealer, in reference to Gerda. And it is Gerda’s ordeal that provides the narrative with its emotional center of gravity.

When “The Danish Girl” was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival this year, Kyle Buchanan, writing for Vulture, complained that it was part of a trend of “queer and trans films that are actually about straight people.” Not that the emphasis on Gerda’s experience is illegitimate. She is called upon to support the man she loves as he erases himself from her life, and Ms. Vikander registers the anguish and ambivalence, as well as the passionate loyalty, that Gerda feels as Einar gives way to Lili.

But unlike Jill Soloway’s Amazon series “Transparent,” which embeds gender transition in a dense and detailed weave of family relations, “The Danish Girl” takes place in the airless, elegant atmosphere of quality filmmaking. Every scene is wrapped around a neat nub of feeling. The dialogue is carefully balanced between modern sensibilities and the imaginary language of Fancy Old Europe, which is really just English spoken in a variety of lovely and heterogeneous accents.

Mr. Hooper’s tasteful, earnest, didactic style — magnified by Alexandre Desplat’s decorously overwrought score — does the film no favors. And the asymmetry between the central performances doesn’t help, either. Mr. Redmayne is a master of technique, adept at significant gestures, freighted glances and the kind of showiness that masquerades as subtlety. As a result, the passage from Einar to Lili is almost entirely a matter of artifice and surface. Einar’s fingers brush against the ballerina’s dresses hanging in Ulla’s studio. Mr. Redmayne alters the angle of his neck, the rhythm of his walk, the timbre of his voice and the set of his mouth. It’s all very impressive, as it was when he traced the progress of Stephen Hawking’s neurological illness in “The Theory of Everything.” But like that much-praised performance, this one does not take us where we need to go, which is inside the character’s mind and spirit.

Ms. Vikander, in contrast, acts from the inside out, with an openness and spontaneity that is especially rare in movies like this one. Whether she is painting, smoking, embracing her husband or offering her hand to the woman who replaces him, Gerda is the one figure onscreen who seems to breathe the sharp air of reality. The others have been painted, with practiced skill and impeccable intentions, by numbers.

“The Danish Girl” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sex, not to be confused with gender. Running time: 2 hours.

The president doesn’t bear full responsibility for the fractured state of our politics. The causes are complicated. They predate the Obama presidency, and Republicans have certainly played a role. (For some on the right, compromise is in principle capitulation.)

Yet it was Barack Obama who in 2008 wanted us to “rediscover our bonds to each other” and put an end to the “constant petty bickering that’s come to characterize our politics.” He utterly failed in that and has to own his part in it. According to a new Pew Research Center study, 79 percent of Americans view the country as more politically divided than in the past.

Today our political discourse barely allows us to think clearly about, let alone rise to meet, the enormous challenges we face at home and abroad. Trust in government has reached one of its lowest levels in the past half-century. Americans are deeply cynical about the entire political enterprise; they are losing faith in the normal democratic process.

This creates the conditions for the rise of demagogues, of people who excel at inflaming tensions. Enter Donald J. Trump, who delights in tearing down the last remaining guardrails in our political culture.

Mr. Obama is hardly responsible for Mr. Trump, and it’s up to my fellow Republican primary voters to repudiate his malignant candidacy. Not doing so would be a moral indictment of our party. But in amplifying some of the worst tendencies in our politics, Mr. Obama helped make the rise of Mr. Trump possible.
“Apparently they’re scared of widows and orphans coming in to the United States of America as part of our tradition of compassion,” Mr. Obama said. “That doesn’t sound very tough to me.” According to the president, the most potent recruitment tool for the Islamic State isn’t jihadist social media or battlefield victories but Republican rhetoric. “They’ve been playing on fear in order to try to score political points or to advance their campaigns,” he said.

The president flippantly dismissed worries about the vetting process despite the fact that, as James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, said in September, the possibility that the Islamic State might infiltrate operatives among Syrian refugees is “a huge concern of ours.”

Administration officials also acknowledge that there are limitations on determining the history of Syrian refugees since we’re in no position to collect vital information from Syria. Even if the president believes the case for accepting refugees overrides those concerns (as I basically do), he should acknowledge their legitimacy.

What made Mr. Obama’s assault on Republicans particularly outrageous is his hypocrisy, by which I mean the president’s failure to act in any meaningful way to avert the humanitarian disaster now engulfing Syria. It’s not as if options weren’t available to him.

In 2012 Mr. Obama rebuffed plans to arm Syrian rebels despite the fact that his former secretaries of defense and state, his C.I.A. director and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff supported them. He repeatedly insisted he would not put American soldiers in Syria or pursue a prolonged air campaign. He refused to declare safe havens or no-fly zones. And it was also in 2012 that Mr. Obama warned the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, that using chemical weapons would cross a “red line.” Yet when Mr. Assad did just that, Mr. Obama did nothing.

The president, perhaps fearful of offending the pro-Assad Iranian government with which he was trying to negotiate a nuclear arms deal, chose to sit by while a humanitarian catastrophe unfolded. As Walter Russell Mead wrote in The American Interest, “This crisis is in large part the direct consequence of President Obama’s decision to stand aside and watch Syria burn.” Some of us find it a bit nervy for the president to lecture the opposition party for heartlessness because cleaning up after his failure raises security concerns.

A reasonable approach would take account of both the humanitarian crisis in Syria and the concerns of critics of the president’s proposal. Doing so might result in a pause in the process to reassess our security procedures, make improvements where necessary and then proceed. Under the leadership of the new speaker, Paul Ryan, the House has passed just such a proposal with a broad bipartisan majority — 47 Democrats sided with Republicans — but Mr. Obama has promised to veto it if it passes the Senate. In his Manichaean conception of politics, such balance has no place, it seems.

What we have seen and heard from Mr. Obama during the Syrian crisis — self-righteousness without self-reflection, taunting, exasperation that others don’t see the world just as he does, the inability to work constructively with his opponents — have been hallmarks of his presidency. The man who promised to strengthen our political culture has further disabled it.

IN 2008, Barack Obama won the presidency promising that he would heal our political divisions. Instead, Mr. Obama has been as polarizing as any president in the history of modern polling. The debate over the Syrian refugee crisis illustrates why.

The civil war in Syria has created one of the worst refugee crises since World War II, and the president has instructed his administration to admit at least 10,000 refugees in fiscal year 2016. Republicans in Congress, in the aftermath of the massacre in Paris on Nov. 13, called for a pause in this process, in part because of their fear that terrorists might pose as refugees. The president, rather than trying to persuade his critics, mocked them.

Many Los Angeles residents are familiar with a sight that may seem strange to outsiders: an oil pump operating mere feet from businesses or homes. A recent lawsuit claims that the city has systematically failed to address drilling’s environmental consequences, especially in lower-income neighborhoods that are majority black and Latino.

Los Angeles is currently home to over 1,000 oil wells. The 1970 California Environmental Quality Act requires the city to conduct a preliminary review before approving a new drilling project to determine whether a more extensive review of its environmental impact is necessary. The lawsuit, filed by the advocacy groups Youth for Environmental Justice, the South Central Youth Leadership Coalition and the Center for Biological Diversity, alleges that the city routinely exempts projects from that provision. The plaintiffs found only one case in which the city actually required a full environmental review for oil drilling.

The suit further alleges that the city grants drilling applications in a discriminatory manner — for instance, by allowing dirtier diesel drilling rigs in the majority-black and Latino neighborhoods of South Los Angeles and Wilmington, while requiring quieter and less polluting electric rigs on the city’s wealthier west side. And it says the city has required higher walls around drill sites in majority-white neighborhoods, offering residents there greater protection from dust, sounds and lights.

Pollutants from oil drilling, such as benzene, can cause cancer and other illnesses. Wilmington’s cancer rate is among the highest in Southern California. Residents there and in South Los Angeles have also experienced headaches, nosebleeds, asthma and eye irritation, among other health problems. Some have complained of drilling noise that goes on all night. One drilling site is less than 100 feet from a clinic serving people with HIV. Many wells are very close to playgrounds, homes or schools.

Environmental justice advocates have been saying for years that poor people and racial minorities are disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards around the country. Los Angeles appears to be a dramatic example of this problem.

Michael LoGrande, the city’s planning director and a defendant in the suit, said before the suit was filed that the city would seek expert advice and acknowledged that “Angelenos residing in communities throughout the city have been and continue to be affected by oil drilling operations.”

City officials declined to comment to The Times on the lawsuit, but their duty seems clear: to review the potential environmental impact of all new drilling projects, as the 1970 law requires, and then to figure out what steps need to be taken to protect people from hazards associated with oil wells. In addition, the city should arrange for appropriate medical care for those who become sick.

A more thorough examination of drilling applications may force Los Angeles to examine a larger question, too: whether drilling for oil so close to homes and schools is ever truly safe.
Brendan Fallis, the D.J., entrepreneur and fashion model who is engaged to Hannah Bronfman, had a conundrum that many men concerned with fitness and style can relate to.

“I wanted to be in better shape, but I didn’t want to change my wardrobe, because suddenly I’d have to buy all new clothes if I really beefed up,” said Mr. Fallis, 36, a former competitive skier who favors slim-cut jeans and trim-fitting jackets.

Last summer while D.J.-ing a party at the Surf Lodge in Montauk, N.Y., he met Stephen Cheuk, a personal trainer who was running a pop-up fitness class at the hotel. He was struck by Mr. Cheuk’s holistic approach, which advocates working out, not just to look better but to build a more efficient body.

“Every other trainer I’ve had, people are just kind of training you but don’t necessarily want to see you improve and get better or care about your eating and the balance of your body,” said Mr. Fallis, who now trains with Mr. Cheuk fives times a week at S10 Training in Lower Manhattan. “It’s nice to have someone who wants to see the betterment of yourself.”

In the era of cultish spinning classes and boot camps, Mr. Cheuk’s highly personalized gym stands out. The self-selecting clientele includes a number of stylish men like Mr. Fallis: the designer Waris Ahluwalia, the D.J. Mick Batyske and the denim maker Jake Sargent.

“We don’t really have any meatheads,” Mr. Cheuk said. “It’s not that type of place.”

Like many personal trainers, Mr. Cheuk, 36, did not start out seeking to become one. Born in Perth, Australia, he studied graphic design before moving to New York in 2009 after breaking up with a girlfriend, whom he had moved with to Dubai.

An avid athlete who played soccer, rugby and ran track, he worked out regularly. He was looking for a job when a friend clued him in on the fact that he could make money showing other people how to exercise. “I kind of fell into it, and it became a real passion, helping people, changing people’s lives,” he said.

With his rugged good looks and affable attitude, Mr. Cheuk took easily to training. He started at the Printing House and later at Gotham Gym, both in the West Village. Along the way, he learned the latest trends in fitness and nutrition, and developed a client base that follows him still.

“He’s always taking courses and bringing that education back,” said Mr. Ahluwalia, the fashion designer and actor who has been working with Mr. Cheuk since the trainer’s Printing House days. “In some fantasy world, I’d take those courses, too.”

In 2012, clients began asking Mr. Cheuk if he planned to open a gym of his own, and when one offered to finance the majority of it as a silent partner, Mr. Cheuk jumped. S10, which stands for sub-10-percent (the level of body fat he encourages male clients to attain), occupies an 1,800-square-foot storefront space on Walker Street.

“We want to be very hidden,” Mr. Cheuk said. “We have tinted windows. We train so many people that are in creative fields, artists, people in fashion. To me, a lot of gyms are so ugly. You go in there, the lighting, the pictures they have on the walls, it’s just very tacky. I wanted something very chic, high design, but very minimalist.”

New clients go through a process that includes careful measurement of body fat. “In New York, everybody’s very vain,” Mr. Cheuk said. “It’s all about vanity. It was always about body composition so we just wanted to develop a system where that was the main focus.”

Workouts at S10 involve a combination of strength, flexibility and cardiovascular training. The workouts rely on equipment common in pro football (like pushing a weighted sled down a turf track). Clients who reach their “sub” level are rewarded not only with taut tummies but also a month of free training, which can add up: S10 charges $100 to $200 for each hourlong session.

Though his clients want more of him, Mr. Cheuk is trying carve out time for other projects, including a matcha tea cafe in Sydney and a boot camp retreat in Costa Rica this winter. Call it Club Med for the sub-10-percent set.

“You train in the morning, there’s activities to do during the day, you come back in the evening and you do another training session or yoga, and then dinner, then bed,” he said. “Then repeat again.”

“We might drink on the last night,” he said. “But we want it to be healthy.”
When they say the three most stressful things in life are death, divorce and moving, they’re leaving off the fourth: gift-giving. What do you get for a person who keeps an eye on the most current “it” objects, or for the 15-year-old member of Generation Z who thinks your taste is “soooo lame”? Take a load off; we’re here to put the “happy” back in holidays. 
It was 61 degrees on a recent November evening, but the scaffolds outside Lord & Taylor on Fifth Avenue were trimmed with artificial fir, and Santa Claus himself was bopping with Liz Rodbell, the store’s president, to Austin Mahone’s “Mmm Yeah.”

Mr. Mahone, a clean-scrubbed pop star, was crooning it live to a gathering of hundreds of teenage girls, who were crowded behind the metal barricades that surrounded the makeshift theater, chirping “mmm, mmm, yeah, yeah” in response.

The occasion was the unveiling of Lord & Taylor’s holiday windows, an event that, like similar vernissages at competitors such as Bloomingdale’s, Bergdorf Goodman and Barneys New York, has increasingly become a big-budget spectacle. (Mr. Mahone’s performance, which ended with “The Christmas Song,” followed Nick Jonas’s from last year.)

After hugs and thanks, the curtains covering the windows were pulled back: a conveyor belt of iced cakes revolved through one window; a Victorian gingerbread house was hoisted by a platoon of gingerbread men (and a digital video montage of more) in another.

These windows — assembled in a cavernous shop (Santa’s Workshop meets “American Horror Story” set) located stories below Lord & Taylor’s 1914 building and lifted into place on original truck-size hydraulic elevators — are the store’s largest and most involved of the year. They have to be: For Lord & Taylor, as for most department stores, the holiday season is when the money gets made.

“The Christmas season is like the Super Bowl for us,” Ms. Rodbell said.

In the two weeks before Thanksgiving, all of New York’s major department stores would follow suit, revealing the holiday windows that have been, in some cases, more than a year in the making. It is a city tradition stretching back to the 19th century. R. H. Macy had Christmas-themed windows in his original store on 14th Street in the 1870s; this year, at Macy’s Herald Square, Snoopy and the Peanuts gang are recreating key scenes from “A Charlie Brown Christmas.”

None of this is news to the merchants who must plan and execute ever larger and more effective displays. The talk is jolly (these windows are a “gift to New York”), but the stakes are real. According to MasterCard SpendingPulse, which tracks retail sales across all payment types, 24 percent of annual department-store sales are made in November and December.
This year, the season arrives on a tide of bad news: Many department-store stocks have tumbled in recent months, inventories are bloated and customer spending is down (3.3 percent since February for department stores, according to SpendingPulse).

But here come the windows. Day after day in the lead-up to Thanksgiving (and the all-important Black Friday, so named — at least according to widely accepted legend — because it is the day when stores’ ledgers finally move from the red to the black), the New York department stores showed their long-in-the-works plans.

“I’ve actually never been to the actual unveiling of windows,” said the actress Jane Krakowski, at the debut of Bloomingdale’s Lexington Avenue windows, whose flowers and faceted sculptures, representing the five senses, had been designed in collaboration with her friend, the florist Jeff Leatham. A marching band had just finished playing. “As I drove up in the cab, I was like, ‘Oh, this is a thing!’”

In investment and planning, competition and anxiety, pomp and circumstance, a thing is what it is.

“This is the largest visual investment of the year, every year,” said Joshua Schulman, the president of Bergdorf Goodman, declining to specify an amount. It is such that, as with many stores, partnerships with outside companies help Bergdorf to underwrite it.

This year, the store’s window maestros Linda Fargo and David Hoey and their team worked with Swarovski to hand-set more than seven million crystals in its tableaus — about 70 times as many as bedazzled the most recent Oscars ceremony. The windows are Swarovski’s biggest collaboration ever: fantastical scenes in which a monkey fortune teller gazes into a crystal ball and a faux-pearl-studded Poseidon presides over the sea. The store ran a contest on its Instagram account, awarding a gift card to the person who came closest to guessing the total number of crystals used.

The theme, “Brilliant Holiday,” grew out of a need to promote its renovated jewelry salon, which will open in December. (The windows also celebrate Swarovski’s 120th anniversary.)

The “Brilliant” theme also dominates Bergdorf’s holiday catalog mailer and is expressed through limited-edition merchandise created for the store. Alice & Olivia designed a Swarovski-blinged jumpsuit ($898); Brett Heyman of Edie Parker, a selection of stone-crusted Atelier Swarovski clutches ($1,400 to $4,200); Badgley Mischka, an embroidered evening gown ($2,995).

The dresses created for the windows themselves, by Johnson Hartig of Libertine, Naeem Khan and CD Greene, are available for those flush enough to inquire. Last year, Ms. Fargo said, a client asked about a gown Dolce & Gabbana made for the window. (The high-five-figure price was ultimately too steep; it was donated to the Fashion Institute of Technology instead.)

Many stores still do not put products, even special-edition products, in their holiday windows, but the move to integrate windows into the store’s business and marketing is nearly universal. At Bloomingdale’s, Mr. Leatham will have pop-up stores selling his book, his candles and his Waterford crystal designs in select stores, a first for a window collaborator.

Even Lord & Taylor, the most traditionally minded of the stores, will make the concession to contemporary commerce: It will sell holiday gingerbread and sweets, inspired by its gingerbread and patisserie windows.
“I think with each consecutive year what gets more important is that we’ve become more and more holistic and integrated in how we approach holiday with the store,” Ms. Fargo said. “It’s not just a window discussion. Everyone throws the word ‘omni’ around. It’s kind of an omni world now.”

At Saks Fifth Avenue, the store’s new president, Marc Metrick, a veteran executive who took over in April, agreed.

“I’ve been at Saks for a long time,” he said. “I’ve seen all the iterations of the windows from when it was — I hate to say this — just windows.”

Saks spared no expense to make sure its holiday display dazzled. Its six central windows depict six icy wonders of the world (a frozen Taj Mahal, a cold Colosseum), with the seventh being the enormous Winter Palace erected in lights above them on the store’s Fifth Avenue facade.

The wintry theme will be expressed in all Saks stores (even in locales as unchilly as Palm Beach, Fla.), store mailers and new products commissioned or selected for gifting — like entry-level lip balms and holiday teddy bears, and $250,000 jewelry.

“What we’ve got to do is convert,” said Mark Briggs, the executive vice president of HBC Creative (the in-house promotional unit of Hudson’s Bay Company, the owner of Saks), noting that, after last year’s holiday event, foot traffic in the New York store increased. “What we don’t want is, ’Oh, that’s very nice,’ come to the door, click, click, click, they do Instagram, and go. What we’re doing is hopefully converting them to customers.”

Window tourism is, after all, a time-honored New York holiday tradition. According to NYC & Company, the city’s destination marketing organization, 30 percent of last year’s total visitation took place in the fourth quarter of the year, more than in any other season; typically five million visitors come to the city between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Eve alone.
Jon Harari, whose company, WindowsWear, offers guided tours of retail windows year-round, said that demand is two to three times greater during the holidays than the rest of the year, and he increases capacity of the tours that his company runs to 50 people, from 30. Mr. Harari added that the tours, which run five days a week for $34.99 a spot, were sold out until Dec. 5 even before Thanksgiving.

Windows alone will not carry stores from decline to success, but industry analysts believe that they can help.

“The department stores are facing Generation Z and the post-millennial,” said Oliver Chen, a managing director at the financial services firm Cowen and Company. “They’re thinking hard about bricks and clicks, the integration of on- and off-line. The reason for going to a store — the bar is higher. It’s really up to the retailers to provide the right balance of theater and commercial.”

Theater has long been one of the draws of the windows at Barneys. It was a hallmark of the windows under Simon Doonan, now the store’s creative ambassador at large (“There’s nothing I haven’t put in a window,” he said, including the writer David Rakoff, who saw “patients” behind glass as a costumed Sigmund Freud). Under Dennis Freedman, the current creative director, live performances have become standard.

Last year the holiday program, created in collaboration with the director Baz Luhrmann, featured ice skaters and a break-dancing elf; this year, sculptors in custom (and for-sale) Moncler puffer suits carve giant ice blocks in refrigerated windows. The theme is “Chillin’ Out,” and other windows feature a huge icicle sculpture by the glass artist Dale Chihuly and a slot-car track racing mini Lexuses (a sponsor) through the tundra.

“It is more ambitious than anything we’ve done,” Mr. Freedman said. “We did not chill out. In fact, I think we had more all-nighters.”

Nationwide, Barneys stores will have Chillin’ Out hangtags and gift wrap, Chillin’ Out holiday gift cards, Chillin’ Out specials at store restaurants and Chillin’ Out merchandising in print mailers and online. Chillin’ Out marshmallows on sticks, covered in white chocolate and coconut, will be given to shoppers each weekend.

While it is important that the windows reach even larger audiences digitally through online extensions and social media courtship, bringing crowds to the actual store remains a priority. Creating a destination “is potentially more important than ever,” said Mark Lee, the Barneys chief executive. “E-commerce and the digital world continues to boom, so to have a reason to visit the physical store, that is an important driver today.”

Though many executives drew a line between the art of window display and the science of commerce, Mr. Freedman believes that the right window leads to sales. “I absolutely do, 100 percent,” he said. “The reason you come in — you either go to our competition or you go here — is because it feels right. You walk in here and you relate to it.”

None of the retailers interviewed would share specific holiday numbers, but the ends, they suggested, justified the means.

“There’s a commercial element that makes it a viable way to spend our marketing dollars, for sure,” said Mr. Metrick of Saks, calling the holiday season “the biggest opportunity of the year.” A few days later, the company shut down a stretch of Fifth Avenue to inaugurate the first Winter Palace light show (it will continue every evening until Jan. 10) with fireworks and a 200-member chorus.

In the name of secrecy and the least possible traffic hindrance, the team tested the show in 4 a.m. run-throughs in the days before its start. A crowd of V.I.P.s, press and passers-by watched from across Fifth, sipping cocoa; a much larger group tuned in via an Internet live stream.

The night it was revealed, temperatures hovered in the 30s, and Mr. Metrick gave a short speech thanking his team and their partners, as the last major set of department-store windows after more than week of unveilings up and down the avenue were about to be seen.

Then he added the grace note: “I wouldn’t be a retailer if I didn’t remind everyone that after the show, the store is open.”
Life as a teenager can be down right chaotic,” the actress Yara Shahidi, 15, told an audience last month at Cipriani 42nd Street, where she was being honored by the Young Women’s Leadership Network. “We must also realize that it is up to us whether these years will feel like a melancholy struggle or an opportunity for growth or experiences of a lifetime.”

For Ms. Shahidi, it’s certainly the latter.

As the actress who plays Zoey, the smart but entitled daughter on ABC’s “Black-ish,” a situation comedy about a prosperous black family wrestling with racial issues, Ms. Shahidi certainly has a platform to be heard. But she has not stopped there.

When she’s not taping “Black-ish,” she is a full-time social activist, inspiring young women to excel academically, volunteering at medical clinics and starting her own mentoring club.

“I’m filming nine and a half hours a day five days a week, but whenever I have a free moment, I’m talking to the U.N. or working on how to get Yara’s Club launched,” Ms. Shahidi said, referring to a mentoring program with the Young Women’s Leadership Network. “Giving back is not just something you do as an adult.”

There are few African-American actresses her age who are having the kind of cultural and social impact that Ms. Shahidi is, both on and off screen. This year, she was nominated for a Teen Choice Award for best breakout star. She won a N.A.A.C.P. Image Award for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series.

She was also recognized by the N.A.A.C.P. for her commitment to service and scholarship. Last month, Ms. Shahidi met with UN Women, an organization dedicated to gender equality. And before that, she spoke at the Paley Center for Media on a panel titled “Cracking the Code: Diversity, Hollywood & STEM.”

Plus, she was featured in the Brooks Brothers fall 2015 advertising campaign.

“I think one of the things that makes Yara so unique is that she is really breaking down a lot of stereotypes for people, but she is also such a normal teenager,” said Colleen Wormsley, a public relations and talent manager for DoSomething.org, a nonprofit group that helps young people take action on social change.

This year, Ms. Shahidi recorded a public service announcement for the organization to encourage young women to go into what educators call the STEM fields (for science, technology, engineering and mathematics).

Activism runs in her family. “I was raised by a bunch of humanitarians,” she said, referring to her African-American mother, Keri-Salter Shahidi, a commercial actress, and her Iranian father, Afshin Shahidi, a cinematographer. Her maternal grandfather was involved in the civil rights movement.

Born in Minneapolis, Ms. Shahidi has been in front of the camera since she was six months old, appearing in a print ad for a life insurance company.

These days, she is breaking the mold of the self-absorbed, vacuous and angst-ridden teenage star. While she does post plenty of selfies on Instagram, none of the photos so much as bare her midriff. “I frequently wear things that are far too conservative for a teenager,” Ms. Shahidi recently told InStyle.
Indeed, her Instagram biography describes her as a “current humanitarian.”

She also takes her academics seriously: She is enrolled in AP calculus and honors chemistry and maintains a 4.6 grade point average. She is tutored on set and is enrolled in the Dwight School Open World, an online program.

While she plays a technology-addicted teenager on “Black-ish,” the driving force in Ms. Shahidi’s social life is not centered around her iPhone 6 (pink case, lots of stickers), but in giving back.

She says her mission to advance equality includes her character Zoey, who is also 15. “Before I auditioned for ‘Black-ish,’ I received scripts that portrayed black people in a negative and stereotypical way,” she said. “But ‘Black-ish’ is a more positive portrayal of what it’s like to be black in America.”
Watching the rapturous reactions to the performances of Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande on the American Music Awards last Sunday, you would have been hard-pressed to recall that one was an immature scofflaw recently dismissed as a has-been, and the other’s career seemed all but dead after getting caught on video licking a doughnut at a Southern California bakery and saying, “I hate America.”

But everyone loves a redemption story, and in this era of six-second Snapchat fame, it seems a pop star can go from “Over” to “Comeback” in record time.

“Ariana Slays! Bieber is Back,” Michael Buckley, a YouTube entertainer, wrote on Twitter after the two performed hits from their recent albums on Sunday’s show.

Billboard gushed over Mr. Bieber’s soulful, rain-soaked performance of “Sorry,” saying, “It was practically an artistic baptism on live TV.” USA Today had these words for Ms. Grande’s Marilyn Monroe-inspired catchy dance hit “Focus:” “Nailed it!”

Award shows have long been opportunities for the second-chance crowd to re-emerge after a penitent time out: Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus and Kanye West among them.

But unlike artists who sometimes had to wait years to be embraced again by the public (think of Frank Sinatra’s long years in the wilderness before teaming with Nelson Riddle in the 1950s for a series of now-classic albums), the pop stars of today bounce back with whiplash-inducing speed.

Jayne Charneski, an audience and consumer strategist who used to work at the talent agency Creative Artists Agency, attributes this phenomenon to (what else?) social media. “If the story is written in real time, it can be changed in real time,” she said. “Young people understand this. They too are in charge of their own brand online.”

Ms. Grande, the erstwhile doughnut licker, managed to spin the incident last July into a lesson on childhood obesity on Twitter, writing, “We need to do more to educate ourselves and our children on the dangers of overeating and the poison that we put into our bodies.” (Which does raise the question: What was she doing at a doughnut shop in the first place?)

Mr. Bieber had more to atone for: assault, pounding his neighbor’s house with raw eggs and being charged in Miami with drunken driving and resisting arrest. People even petitioned the White House last year to deport Mr. Bieber, a native of Canada.

Since then, he has embraced spirituality, naming his album, tellingly, “Purpose.” And he is practicing humility after a fashion, recently apologizing to fans on Twitter for walking offstage at a concert in Norway and to the television host Stephen Colbert for skipping out on an appearance.

“The Internet makes the news cycle,” said Ilan Zechory, a founder of Genius, a website that publishes annotated songs and other content. “You don’t have to wait for an interview on television anymore.”

Indeed, the teary pit stop before Barbara Walters or Diane Sawyer (to wit: Britney Spears in 2003) is no longer a rite of passage. Four years later, Ms. Spears shaved her head, went to rehab and battled for custody of her two children. In September 2007, she appeared at the MTV Video Music Awards in Las Vegas. But with scant social media love to boost her comeback, her awkward lip-syncing of “Gimme More” after months of silence confirmed fans’ worst fears.

“She is 25 years old and she’s already accomplished everything she’s going to accomplish in her life,” joked the show’s host, the comedian Sarah Silverman.

Now pop stars are better at managing their media message, melding good and bad times (though some sins, like Chris Brown assaulting Rihanna in 2009, stick longer than others).

“The redemption theme even plays into the lyrics,” Mr. Zechory said of Mr. Bieber’s new album. “Sorry,” “Love Yourself” and “Life Is Worth Living” are all titles from “Purpose.” And recently Mr. Bieber told Complex magazine that he wanted to live an honest life like Jesus Christ. “Love, life, peace and happiness,” Mr. Zechory said. “Until it gets boring.”

All the tweets in the world won’t help if there isn’t the music to back it up. Miley Cyrus, who offended fans with her scantily clad, bottom-grinding gyrations two years ago, got back into their good graces at the 2014 MTV Music Video Awards after a yearlong media onslaught. But it was her blockbuster album, “Bangerz,” that secured her place (for now).

Robin Thicke wasn’t so lucky. He followed up his 2013 breakout hit “Blurred Lines” with “Paula,” a self-proclaimed apology to his former wife, Paula Patton, for being unfaithful. (Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic called it “the musical equivalent of a Facebook friend who refuses to stop overdoing it on tequila slammers and ranting about the demise of their relationship.”)

Ms. Grande’s and Mr. Bieber’s American Music Awards performance resonated with fans because, well, they liked it. “One day you can be licking doughnuts and being disgusting, and then you have a performance like ‘Focus,’” said Dave Bakula, a senior vice president for industry insights at Nielsen Entertainment.

Mr. Bieber’s album, too, is a hit. “Purpose” debuted at No. 1 and tied a record held by the Beatles and 50 Cent: having three of the top five Billboard songs in a week.

More impressively, Mr. Bakula said “Purpose” had 100 million audio streams. “If you are shunned and forgotten and hated, you don’t have 100 million streams,” he said.

But mostly, Ms. Charneski said, this year’s young musicians will be forgiven quickly because licking doughnuts and throwing eggs are something almost every kid can relate to. “Even when these kids are bad, they aren’t really that bad,” she said.
My interview with Justin McLeod was winding down when I tossed out one last question: “Have you ever been in love?”

The baby-faced chief executive had designed Hinge, which was a new dating app. My question was an obvious throwaway.

Justin looked stricken. No one, he said, had ever asked him that in an interview. “Yes,” he finally answered. “But I didn’t realize it until it was too late.” Then he asked me to turn off my recorder. I hit Stop.

Off the record, he looked relieved to unburden himself. Her name was Kate. They were college sweethearts. He kept breaking her heart. (Tears now swelled in his eyes.) He wasn’t the best version of himself back then. He had since made amends to everyone, including Kate. But she was now living abroad, engaged to someone else.

“Does she know you still love her?” I asked.

“No,” he said. “She’s been engaged for two years now.”

“Two years?” I said. “Why?”

“I don’t know.”

I was by then a year into a separation from a two-decade marriage. I had been doing a lot of thinking about the nature of love, its rarity. The reason I was interviewing Justin, in fact, was that his app had helped facilitate a post-separation blind date, my first ever, with an artist for whom I had fallen at first sight.

That had never happened to me, the at-first-sight part. He was also the first man to pop up on my screen after I downloaded Justin’s app.

For those keeping score at home, those are a lot of firsts: first dating app, first man on my screen, first blind date, first love at first sight. I was interested in understanding the app’s algorithm, how it had come about, how it had guessed, by virtue of our shared Facebook friends, that this particular man, a sculptor with a focus on the nexus between libidinal imagery and blossoms, would take root in my heart.

“You have to tell her,” I said to Justin. “Listen —— ” and I told him the story of the boy I had loved just before meeting my husband.

He was a senior in college, studying Shakespeare abroad. I was a 22-year-old war photographer based in Paris. We had met on a beach in the Caribbean, then I visited him in London, shell-shocked, after having covered the end of the Soviet-Afghan war.

I thought of him every day I was covering that war. When I was sleeping in caves, so sick from dysentery and an infected shrapnel wound on my hand that I had to be transported out of the Hindu Kush by Doctors Without Borders, my love for him is what kept me going.
But a few weeks after my trip to London, he stood me up. He said he would visit me at my apartment in Paris one weekend and never showed. Or so I thought.

Two decades later, I learned that he actually had flown to Paris that weekend but had lost the piece of paper with my address and phone number. I was unlisted. He had no answering machine. We had no friends in common. He wound up staying in a hostel, and I wound up marrying and having three children with the next man I dated. And so life goes.

By the time Google was invented, the first photo of me to appear on his screen was of my children and me from an article someone had written about my first book, a memoir of my years as a war photographer. Soon after, he married and had three children with the next woman he dated. And so life goes.

I found him by accident, doing research on theater companies for my last novel. There he was above his too-common name. I composed the email: “Are you the same man who stood me up in Paris?”

That’s how I learned what had happened that weekend and began to digest the full impact of our missed connection.

His work brought him to New York a few months later, and we met for a springtime lunch on a bench in Central Park. I was so flummoxed, I kicked over my lemonade and dropped my egg salad sandwich: Our long-lost love was still there.

In fact, the closure provided by our reunion and the shock of recognition of a still-extant love that had been deprived of sun and water would thereafter affect both of our marriages, albeit in different ways. He realized how much he needed to work on tending to his marriage. I realized I had given mine all the nutrients and care I could — 23 years of tilling that soil — but the field was fallow.

Hearing of Justin’s love for Kate while seated on another New York City bench four years later, I felt a fresh urgency. “If you still love her,” I told him, “and she’s not yet married, you have to tell her. Now. You don’t want to wake up in 20 years and regret your silence. But you can’t do it by email or Facebook. You actually have to show up in person and be willing to have the door slammed in your face.”

He laughed wistfully: “I can’t do that. It’s too late.”

Three months later, he emailed an invitation to lunch. The article I wrote about him and his company, in which he had allowed me to mention Kate (whom I had called his “Rosebud”), had generated interest in his app, and he wanted to thank me.

On the appointed day, I showed up at the restaurant and found the hostess. “Justin McLeod, table for two,” I said.

“No,” he said, suddenly behind me. “For three.”

“Three? Who’s joining us?”

“She is,” he said, pointing to a wisp of a woman rushing past the restaurant’s window, a blur of pink coat, her strawberry blond hair trailing behind her.

“What the —— ? Is that Rosebud?”

“Yes.”

Kate burst in and embraced me in a hug. Up close she resembled another Kate — Hepburn, who had appeared in the comedies of remarriage I had studied in college with Stanley Cavell.

These films, precursors to today’s rom-coms, were made in America in the 1930s and ’40s, when showing adultery or illicit sex wasn’t allowed. To pass the censors, the plots were the same: A married couple divorced, flirted with others, then remarried. The lesson? Sometimes you have to lose love to refind it, and a return to the green world is the key to reblossoming.

“This is all because of you,” Kate said, crying. “Thank you.”

Now Justin and I were tearing up, too, to the point where the other diners were staring at us, confused.

After we sat down, they told me the story of their reunion, finishing each other’s sentences as if they had been married for years. One day, after a chance run-in with a friend of Kate’s, Justin texted Kate to arrange a phone conversation, then booked a trans-Atlantic flight to see her without warning. He called her from his hotel room, asked if he could stop by. She was to be married in a month, but three days later, she moved out of the apartment she had been sharing with her fiancé.

I felt a pang of guilt. The poor man!

It was O.K., she said. Their relationship had been troubled for years. She had been trying to figure out a way to postpone or cancel the wedding, but the invitations had already been sent, the hall and caterer booked, and she didn’t know how to resolve her ambivalence without disappointing everyone.

Justin had arrived at her door at nearly the last moment he could have spoken up or forever held his peace. By the time of our lunch, the two were already living together.

Soon afterward, I had them over for dinner to introduce them to the blossom-obsessed artist who bore half of the responsibility for their reunion. He and I hadn’t worked out as a couple, much to my pain and chagrin, but we had found our way back into a close friendship and even an artistic collaboration after he texted me a doodle he’d been drawing.

In fact, we had just signed a contract to produce three books together: “The ABC’s of Adulthood,” “The ABC’s of Parenthood” and — oh, the irony — “The ABC’s of Love.”

“What was the doodle?” Kate asked.

I showed her the drawing on my iPhone.

“Are those ovaries?” she asked, smiling.

“Or seeds,” I said. “Or flower buds, depending on how you look at it.”

All perfectly reasonable interpretations of love begetting love begetting love, which is why we were all gathered around my table that night, weren’t we? Because real love, once blossomed, never disappears. It may get lost with a piece of paper, or transform into art, books or children, or trigger another couple’s union while failing to cement your own.

But it’s always there, lying in wait for a ray of sun, pushing through thawing soil, insisting upon its rightful existence in our hearts and on earth.
